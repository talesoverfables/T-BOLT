# T-BOLT : Traffic Bottleneck Out-tracing Logical Tech-Assistant!
<br>Imagine a police officer wearing an AR headset or using a smartphone or tablet with AR capabilities. As the officer walks or drives through the city, the webapp displays real-time information about traffic congestion, parking issues, encroachment of roads and footpaths, and poor road conditions. The AR experience is overlaid on the real world, allowing the officer to see the actual environment with additional valuable information.</br>
## Project Highlights
- Augmented Reality Visual Cues of every bottleneck.
- WebApp with multiple webpages that indicate - Civilian Reports of bottlenecks, Accidents bottlenecks, alerts.
- Integration with Maps for easier nagivation by Police Personnel.
- Pre-trained AI model for traffic and road condition detection.
